<!--  JavaScript:

JavaScript can be compared to the bodyâ€™s ability to perform actions such as walking or talking. 
So when you add JavaScript to HTML and CSS, it transforms the body from being a beautifully dressed 
mannequin into a real-life walking talking human being. It animates the body, giving it lifelike qualities. 
JavaScript can also be compared to a fully functional body that has the ability to interact. As we all know,
 having an interactive website is critical, otherwise its just a boring page filled with information. Here we see a 
 website which consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript: -->

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>Internal JS</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>GeeksforGeeks</h2>
<!-- Internal Js -->
<script>

console.log("Hi SRN, Welcome to JS");
</script>


</body>

</html>
