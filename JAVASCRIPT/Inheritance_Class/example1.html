<!-- Inheritance class -->
<!-- 
Inheritance is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming. This is a mechanism that allows 
the child class to acquire all the properties and methods of a parent class (except private properties and methods).
 We use the keyword extends in a class declaration or a class expression to create a child class of another class.

 Note: If there is a constructor present in the subclass, it needs to first call super() before using “this”. -->
